# ShopSmart
eCommerce extension analyzing user activity & providing heatmap usage patterns, insights into actions & exclusive discount codes for consumers. Helps brands stay ahead of competition


# Inspiration
eCommerce is a field that has seen astronomical growth in recent years, and shows no signs of slowing down. With a forecasted growth rate of 10.4% this year, up to $6.3 trillion in global revenues, we decided to tackle Noibuâ€™s challenge to develop an extension to aide ecommerce developers with the impossible task of staying ahead amongst the fierce competitions in this space, all whilst providing a tremendous unique value to shoppers and eCommerce brands alike.

# What it does
Our extension. ShopSmart, aim to provide developers and brands with an accurate idea of how their website is being used, naturally. Unlike A/B testing, which forces a participant to use a given platform and provide feedback, ShopSmart analyzes user activity on any given website and produces a heatmap showing their exact usage patterns, all without collecting user identifying data. In tandem with the heatmap, ShopSmart provides insights as to the sequences of actions taken on their website, correlated with their heatmap usage, allowing an ever deeper understanding of what average usage truly looks like. To incentivize consumers, brands may elect to provide exclusive discount codes only available through ShopSmart, giving the shoppers a kickback for their invaluable input to the brand partners.

# How we built it
ShopSmart was built using the classic web languages HTML, CSS, and Javascript, keeping it simple, lightweight, and speedy.

# Challenges we ran into
We ran into several challenges throughout our development process, largely due to the complexity of the extension in theory being limited in execution to HTML, CSS, and Javascript (as those are the only allowed languages for use in developing extensions). One issue we had was finding a way to overlay the heatmap over the website so as to visually show the paths the user took. Whilst we were able to solve that challenge, we were sadly unable to finish fully integrating our database within the given timeframe into the extension due to the frequency of data collection/communication, and the complexity of the data itself.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
Our team is very proud in being able to put out a working extension capable of tracking usage and overlaying the resulting heatmap data over the used website, especially as neither of us had any experience with developing extensions. Despite not being able to showcase our extensive database connections in the end as they are not finalized, we are proud of achieving reliable and consistent data flow to our cloud-based database within our testing environment. We are also proud of coming together and solving a problem none of us had considered before, and of course, of the sheer amount we learned over this short time span.

# What we learned
Our hackathon experience was truly transformative, as we not only gained invaluable technical knowledge in Javascript, but also cultivated essential soft skills that will serve us well in any future endeavors. By working together as a team, we were able to pool our unique strengths and collaborate effectively to solve complex problems and bring our ideas to life.

# What's next for ShopSmart
The next steps for ShopSmart are to focus on expanding its capabilities and increasing its reach. One area of focus could be on integrating the extension with more e-commerce platforms to make it more widely accessible to developers and brands. Another area for improvement could be on enhancing the heatmap visualization and adding more advanced analytics features to provide even deeper insights into user behavior. With the help of Machine Learning, developers and brands can utilize the data provided by ShopSmart to better recognize patterns within their customer's usage of their site to make better adjustments and improvements. Additionally, exploring partnerships with e-commerce brands to promote the extension and offer more exclusive discount codes to incentivize consumers could help increase its adoption. Overall, the goal is to continuously improve the extension and make it an indispensable tool for e-commerce businesses looking to stay ahead of the competition.
